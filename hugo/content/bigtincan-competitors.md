  textline: |
    You know the situation -- **shared folders of content in drives with no context, no idea if the content** (ebooks, decks, white papers, one-pagers, battlecards) **is up to date, no idea if it’s the right asset that you should send** at the stage your deals are in. And that’s **if you can even find it**.

    You also know that **marketing and sales isn’t a linear process**. Prospects are engaging across all parts of your funnel, and your teams have created great content, but that only matters if it’s used. **Just like Bigtincan, Content Camel acts as a content management system for all your internal and external sales collateral**, allows you to centralize sales plays, enhances marketing-sales feedback and communication, and provides customizable buyer engagement experiences.

    Wrangle that Drive or Box.
    Increase sales effectiveness.
  textline: |
    Today, you’re probably using Google Drive, Dropbox, or Box to try and organize your customer-facing and internal sales materials. But **your drives are a jumble of internal and external docs, work in progress, and content that you have no idea whether it’s up to date or not**. With all those messy folders, it’s hard to find what you need when you need it and even harder to figure out if it’s accurate.
    So that makes Bigtincan an option, because **25%+ of your Marketing budget might be going to content, but 70% of that content won’t ever be used by Sales**. But unless you have a zillion sales reps and an uncapped budget for sales enablement, you’ll find it difficult to navigate the costs of sales enablement software.

    **At Content Camel, we think all Marketing and Sales teams should be the most effective and efficient they can be**, and we’re here to help with that. Together, let’s:

    * **Reduce the wasted time Sales Reps are spending looking for content** (Up to 43 hours per month!).

    * **Increase the delivery of the right content at the right time** with easily organized assets that map to your buyer’s journey.

    * **Decrease time-to-close** with **tailored content experiences** and **increasing the Sales-Marketing feedback loop**.

faqs:
- headline: Who is Bigtincan a best fit for?
  textline: |
    Bigtincan is a bolted together series of companies covering sales content management to sales training and coaching. Bigtincan describes itself as “AI-Powered Sales Enablement Automation platform that helps you learn faster, sell smarter, and be more productive everyday”, and focuses mainly on very large (1k users) orgs. If you are a very large enterprise that needs sales training and coaching more than sales enablement focused on getting buyers the right content, then Bigtincan may be a fit. 

    <br/>
    If you don’t need advanced coaching and training tools, are looking for a Chrome Extension that makes your content available in all your apps, and are looking for a simple approach to enable sales with findable content and the ability to customize buyer experiences, then Content Camel is a fantastic fit. 
- headline: Is Content Camel right for me and my team?
  textline: |
    Content Camel is designed for small and medium sized teams that are focused on improving their sales productivity and making the most out of their existing marketing budget for content. We’ve designed for enterprise-scale performance, delivered at SMB pricing, but with features that make individual reps ramp up quickly and stick with the product. 

    <br/>
    Content Camel is easy to admin and is a fantastic fit for teams with about 5-30+ sellers. 
- headline: How much does Content Camel cost?
  textline: |
    Unlike most of the enterprise sales enablement solutions (like Bigtincan), Content Camel starts at just $15 per user, with no minimum, no set up costs, and no expensive consulting necessary. That's a huge savings we'd love to see you plow back into great content for your team!

    <br/>
    You can learn more [here on our pricing page](/pricing).  
- headline: How long does it take to roll out Content Camel to my team?
  textline: |
    Content Camel is designed to fit the needs of small and medium sized, fast moving teams. 
    
    <br/>
    Most teams roll out Content Camel the first or second week after signing up -- after they’ve added and imported their most valuable marketing and sales assets.
- headline: What type of content can I store in Content Camel?
  textline: |
    Content Camel allows you to store all content including PDFs (eg ebooks, white papers, battlecards), web page links (eg blog posts, customer stories, industry articles), decks (eg Powerpoint/Keynote slides), images (eg infographics), and sales-focused video content.

    <br/>
    You can keep content internal (not shared) if you want. Perfect for decks.

    <br/>
    You can easily store web pages -- not the easiest thing to do if you're using drives/boxes today.
- headline: Does Content Camel offer integrations with ____ ?
  textline: |
    Content Camel can be used seamlessly with all web apps via our Chrome Extension. 
    
    <br/>
    That means Content Camel can deliver content into tools like Salesforce, Pipedrive, Gmail, Outlook Web, Salesloft, Outreach, Hubspot, and more.
