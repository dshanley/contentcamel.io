- headline: Your content - optimized for Sales and Marketing.
  textline: |
    You're **outgrowing your folders** in Google Drive, Sharepoint, or Dropbox. You have no context, no idea if your content (ebooks, decks, white papers, one-pagers, battlecards) is **up to date**, no idea if **it’s the right asset** that Sales should be using at the stage your deals are in. And that’s **if you can even find it**.

    You also know that **marketing and sales isn’t a linear process**. Prospects are engaging across all parts of your funnel, and your teams have created great content, but that only matters if it’s used. **Just like Uberflip, Content Camel acts as a content management system for all your external sales collateral and marketing assets**, but also your **internal sales playbooks**. It allows you to centralize sales plays, enhances marketing-sales feedback and communication, and provides customizable buyer engagement experiences. 
    
    And yes, it can help you build **resource pages** and **content collections**.

- headline: Search better
  textline: |
    Intelligent search. Smart search. AI-enabled search. Fuzzy matching. Whatever you call it, our search is the most advanced under-the-hood and that means your users will be able to actually **find** what they are looking for.
    
    **New users ramp quickly** because they can filter down on **content types** and **funnel stages** answering questions like "what are the top assets used by the team to build awareness?"
    
    **All users benefit** from advanced search that applies matching based on phrases and partial words along with our ability to index metadata (like info from your blog posts) to make sure no great content goes *unfound*.

    *But you know what?* Admins love our reporting that shows **what's being searched for** and also **what's not being found**, so you can adapt your strategy based on real search volumes.

  textline: |
    Content hubs. Content folders. Content collections. Content playbooks. Like Uberflip's "Hubs", **collections in Content Camel** allow you to group content in meaningful sets to speed up reps drilling down into the right content. 
    
    Content can exist across many collections and with one click **a collection can become a personalized site**. Perfect for your ABM and content-driven campaigns.
    
    **Collections really do enable easy grouping, filtering and personalization of content.**

    Based on collections, easily give sellers the ability to **deliver tailored microsite pages for your prospects**. Great for ABM and personalized followup. Or use them for **partner channel enablement**. Or use them as **marketing resource pages**. 

    Imagine giving your **entire team** the ability to create pages that are **on-brand, personalized, and speak directly to the buyer**. What would they collect up? 

    Whatever you do with site pages, we know it'll be awesome. And simple. And easy.

    Give your sales team the ability to pull in the **right piece of content** into their **existing workflows** in Gmail, Salesforce, Drift, Salesloft and more.

    Uberflip works well with tools like Gmail, Twitter, and LinkedIn, but it can be a bit heavy and clunky for sales reps to use quickly. Content Camel is designed to work with **all** of your web apps and our goal is to make each individual user as productive as possible.

    In addition to finding and viewing content, give all of your users the ability to get **real time notifications** when sharing with recipients.

    Wrangle that Drive or Box.
    Increase sales effectiveness.
  textline: |
    Today, you’re probably using Google Drive, Dropbox, or Box to try and organize your customer-facing and internal sales materials. But **your drives are a jumble of internal and external docs, work in progress, and content that you have no idea whether it’s up to date or not**. With all those messy folders, it’s hard to find what you need when you need it and even harder to figure out if it’s accurate.
    So that makes Uberflip an option, because **25%+ of your Marketing budget might be going to content, but 70% of that content won’t ever be used by Sales** or viewed by most prospects. But unless you have specific needs around publishing flipbooks, you’ll find it difficult to twist Uberflip into your budget and the needs of both Marketing and Sales for resource pages and sales enablement.

    **At Content Camel, we think all Marketing and Sales teams should be the most effective and efficient they can be**, and we’re here to help with that. Together, let’s:

    * **Reduce the wasted time Sales Reps are spending looking for content** (Up to 43 hours per month!).

    * **Increase the delivery of the right content at the right time** with easily organized assets that map to your buyer’s journey.

    * **Decrease time-to-close** with **tailored content experiences** and **increasing the Sales-Marketing feedback loop**.

faqs:
- headline: Who is Uberflip a best fit for?
  textline: |
    Uberflip describes itself as a “a platform to quickly create personalized destinations that surface the most relevant content and messaging based on campaign, audience, and intent data”. They position it for teams launching campaigns and scaling ABM programs, but a lot of their application is suited to simple social media aggregation, website resource pages, and flipbooks. If you need an online magazine replacement, then their flipbooks might be a good choice for you. And, if you need marketing automation integrations and professional design services, then Uberflip might be your best choice.

    <br/>
    If you don’t need complex integrations, and are looking for both marketing content management, tailored buyer exerpiences for ABM, and a tool that will also work for sales enablement, then Content Camel is a fantastic fit.
- headline: Is Content Camel right for me and my team?
  textline: |
    Content Camel is designed for small, medium, and large teams that are focused on improving their sales productivity and making the most out of their existing marketing budget for content. We’ve designed for enterprise-scale performance, delivered at SMB pricing, but with features that make individual reps ramp up quickly and stick with the product. We also make it easy to turn content collections into great resource pages.

    <br/>
    Content Camel is easy to admin and is a fantastic fit for teams with about 5-150+ users. 
- headline: How much does Content Camel cost?
  textline: |
    Unlike **most** of the enterprise sales enablement solutions (like Uberflip), Content Camel starts at just $15 per user (or $12.75/mo annually), with **no minimum**, **no set up costs**, and no expensive consulting necessary. That's a huge savings we'd love to see you plow back into great content for your team!

    <br/>
    You can learn more [here on our pricing page](/pricing/).  
- headline: How long does it take to roll out Content Camel to my team?
  textline: |
    Content Camel is designed to fit the needs of small and medium sized, fast moving teams. 
    
    <br/>
    Most teams roll out Content Camel the first or second week after signing up -- after they’ve added and imported their most valuable marketing and sales assets.
- headline: What type of content can I store in Content Camel?
  textline: |
    Content Camel allows you to store all content including PDFs (eg ebooks, white papers, battlecards), web page links (eg blog posts, customer stories, industry articles), videos (Youtube, Vimeo, uploaded), decks (eg Powerpoint/Keynote slides), images (eg infographics), and sales-focused video content.

    <br/>
    You can keep content internal (not shared) if you want. Perfect for decks. 

    <br/>
    You can easily store web page links (eg blog posts) -- not the easiest thing to do if you're using drives/boxes today!
- headline: Does Content Camel offer integrations with ____ ?
  textline: |
    Content Camel can be used seamlessly with all web apps via our Chrome and Edge Extension.
