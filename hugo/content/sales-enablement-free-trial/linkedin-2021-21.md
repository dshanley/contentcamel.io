- headline: Less searching, more finding
  textline: |
    Intelligent search. Smart search. AI-enabled search. Fuzzy matching. Whatever you call it, our search is the most advanced under-the-hood and that means your users will be able to actually **find** what they are looking for.
    
    **New users ramp quickly** because they can filter down on **content types** and **funnel stages** answering questions like "what are the top assets used by the team to build awareness?"
    
    **All users benefit** from advanced search that applies matching based on phrases and partial words along with our ability to index metadata (like info from your blog posts) to make sure no great content goes *unfound*.

    *But you know what?* Admins love our reporting that shows **what's being searched for** and also **what's not being found**, so you can adapt your strategy based on real search volumes.
