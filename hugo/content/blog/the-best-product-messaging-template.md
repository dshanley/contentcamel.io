## Improve Your Product Messaging with our Product Messaging Template

Here’s the situation -- you sell products or services, but we’ll just call them “products” for simplicity here. Most of the Sales and Marketing team are on the same page about what your product does -- some of the values and benefits it provides, how it’s a bit different and generally how to talk about it. But, you know that consistency is key to driving understanding with your buyer and that only consistency brings the repeatability that drives word of mouth and smooths out the purchasing cycle. 

And you’re frustrated when you hear the CEO give 3 different short versions of the product message (the “elevator pitch” of your product), and you’re frustrated that every single piece of collateral seems to reinvent the wheel, as you message your product. So, you searched for “product messaging template” or “product positioning guide” and here you are.

## What is a product messaging template?

A product messaging template is used to develop all of your messaging for a product or suite of products organized in one place, so you can enable others to effectively communicate to the market about your solution. A complete product messaging document drives consistency and repeatability -- lowering the effort to build additional sales and marketing content.

## What makes good product positioning?
Good product positioning clearly communicates to your buying audience what your product is, who it’s for, what problems it addresses, how it’s differentiated from the competition, and how you uniquely deliver the solution to the buyer’s problem. It’s important that your positioning document enables other teams within Sales and Marketing to accurately generate new content and assets.

Our guide takes a different approach than most other templates that are either too lightweight or incomplete and uses the work that we started in a previous post -- How to Create a Consistent Marketing Message -- to focus on personas. By starting with -- and focusing on -- personas, you’ll develop your product messaging and positioning that’s more aligned with the buyer’s need and helps them move down funnel more quickly. Also, we really like product messaging frameworks that are repeatable across the whole team, so that every piece of collateral that you develop drives home a consistent message.

Here’s a breakdown of the sections and how to fill them in. The final template is meant to be handed off, so we’re actually going to go through this out of order:

1. Context
2. Value Drivers, Differentiators, Proof Points
3. Path to Purchase
4. Features and Benefits
5. Competitors
6. Product Positioning and Messaging

## How to Document the Buyer’s Journey

The Context section of the template provides the background on the buyer’s journey for your audience. A full template for building your ideal customer profiles can be found in our [Marketing Messaging Guide post](/blog/how-to-create-a-consistent-marketing-message), but here we’ll either refer to those personas by name or offer a simplified overview of who we’re serving this content to.

For more background, describe what “jobs” your customers “hire” your product to do. These are the documented use-cases. Some products serve multiple use cases, and if they are sufficiently different,  you might consider doing one template per major use-case. 

For example, Trello is used as a workflow board (a kanban board), but it can also be used as categorized lists (no workflow). That’s two pretty different use cases. 

Limit your use-cases here -- your customers aren’t hiring your product for 20 things -- try to keep it to 3 or less.

Next, capture some high-level keywords and phrases that the prospect would be searching for as they seek to evaluate products like yours. This isn’t an exhaustive SEO analysis, but rather a way to communicate to the team the state of mind and common terms a buyer would be looking for.

Finally, are there any specific, frequent, and niche areas where prospective customers might be hanging out? If there are active online communities for your buyer, then document those here -- these are key resources for your team as they translate this core messaging doc into other assets like eBooks, whitepapers, decks, and web pages.

### No Pain, No Urgency
Similar to the persona messaging template where you documented the frustrations, wants, fears, and aspirations of your audience, we document the **Before State, Negative Consequences, After State**, and **Positive Business Outcomes** in this template.

This is a critical area to spend time on. It drives the urgency behind the sale and will help focus content that’s designed to move the prospect down your funnel.

* **Before State** -- the critical problem or problems your prospective buyer is facing. Hopefully this taps into frustrations they have at a personal level and that they are seeking to resolve. Naturally, it’s something that your product is effective at addressing.

* **Negative Consequences** -- what if your audience did nothing about their problems? What’s the impact? To them? To the business? The more specific and quantified you can be, the better.

* **After State** -- If your audience completes their journey and implements your product, then what does that look like? Describe, in detail, what success looks like in their terms.

* **Positive Business Outcomes** -- Document the value delivered from achieving the After State. This is the quantified benefits from avoiding the Negative Consequences and succeeding in the After State. 

It’s important to split this out. It’s not enough to write down the problems, and it’s not enough to drop in some benefits. Refining the picture of the Before State of your buyer and the gap to achieving the Positive Business Outcomes is the core of what drives urgency for your deals. Without a wide gap, the friction of doing nothing is often too great to overcome.

We’ll get ready in the rest of the template to position your product as the key to achieving the quantified, tangible outcomes we’ve written down in this section.

It is an understatement to say we weren’t the biggest fans of WordPress. Static sites are at the core of Forestry.io’s business model. They provide a more secure, flexible and performant environment than WordPress.

Yet, I’m excited to announce that today we’re moving our Forestry.io website to WordPress. Visit our new site [here](/wordpress.html). 

Forestry.io CMS has done its absolute best to create a seamless, customized UI to any static site. However, our site has some very specific needs that our own CMS can’t fulfill. Let me explain why this move is the right one for us:

WordPress offers all options right on the Dashboard. The user can add widgets and plugins, change the appearance, check the SEO and much more. WordPress can do all that and not even feel crowded.

There’s almost 55,000 plugins. No other platform provides as vast a portfolio of plugins as WordPress does. The ability to quickly add and remove a plugin that implements state-of-the-art technologies is important. And there’s always a fallback plugin if one should fail ([Alternatives to 66 Dead WP Plugins](https://www.whoishostingthis.com/compare/wordpress/dead-plugins/)).

Maintenance and security issues with WordPress are well-known but the team at WordPress is working constantly on [crushing bugs and fixing vulnerabilities](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/latest).

At Forestry.io we love experimentation, whether it's on features, design or communication. Some of these experiments won’t ever see the light of day but our move to WordPress has just become reality. Join us for this wild rollercoaster ride!
