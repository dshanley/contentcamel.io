It‚Äôs always been a challenge driving sales, growth, managing a sales team, and aligning sales and marketing efforts. But, now, it‚Äôs harder than ever. Previously, when we were digging into the buyer‚Äôs journey and a prospect‚Äôs path to making decisions, we were thinking about the 6-10 people involved in [decision making](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey) (Gartner) for B2B purchases. Now, those 6-10 people are fully remote and staying that way. 

So, that leaves us with the challenges (and opportunities) of fully remote sales. Or virtual selling. We talked to some other experts with deep sales and sales enablement experience, and here‚Äôs what we found:

* **Bad news**: prospect engagement is down. Lead volume is probably down for you -- maybe significantly. Your team is working harder, and struggling to get the same amount done.
* **Good news**: Teams are figuring out ways to come together in a remote work setting. Empathy wins more than ever with prospects. The uncertainty is no longer uncertain. 

I was surprised by some of the insights from our interviews. Check out what I discovered below.

## Sales challenges and opportunities ahead

In speaking with several experts across industries that are always thinking about their sales process, sales team management, marketing process, and evolving sales trends, I heard a couple of recurring themes. These recurring trends echo what we're hearing from customers and start to shape up larger shifts happening in the market today.

I caught up with Tim Seims ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timseims)), Director of Building Products Intelligence at John Burns Real Estate Consulting and formerly the Market Segment Manager at Nichiha USA. Tim shared his take on the current trends and reshaping of go to market for the current environment on both the internal team and buyer side of things. 

The impact to sales reps -- all sellers -- and internal teams is significant. Teams continue to adjust to changes and chart a long term path to sales success.

**Your team might look like** this and you're not alone:

* The **self-starters**: Those that have wanted to work remotely in the past -- they are more engaged and more productive.
    * These team members are hustling, eager to get set up with new technology and tools, and are focused on working more efficiently
* The **ghosts**: These lower productivity sellers have failed to meet the real challenges of the transitioning times and can't get organized. Beyond blank screens of missing video, they might simply be missing. The disappeared.
* **Everyone else**: Stuck in the middle, these sales people are figuring it out, but need increased support. They need more logistics and technology help. Plan for more budget, more technology, and some continued home office assistance. 

What's happening with **content, content marketing, and content strategy:**

* **Short form content wins** - There's more activity and engagement to be had on short form content platforms like LinkedIn, Youtube, and social media in general. Think of every seller as a brand ambassador and audience builder leveraging one minute long videos that are simply edited or streamed live.
* **Long form content remains the same**. Long form blogs and a focus on SEO remain largely unchanged both from a content strategy standpoint, but also level of investment and focus. 

Teams and individuals can't simply rely on marketing managers and leadership for the next level plan, because they're often still adjusting and working through the market changes in real time as well. So, don't expect the blue print for social engagement to exist or materialize soon.

The opportunity exists, though, for teams that do hustle and get it together to provide some framework for reps that want to take advantage of the short form, multi-channel approach to sales. It's a compelling way to build, reach, and connect with their target audience in an atmosphere missing the typical networking and handshaking. The lonliness quotient is real and there are gaps to fill with self expression. 

Marketing manager can modify their content strategy and specifically their sales content strategy to include two motions:

* A **"done *for* you"** sales playbook
* A **"done *with* you"** sales playbook

The "done *for* you" approach is the traditional approach and remains largely unchanged. Trending, though, is the **"done *with* you" approach** underutilized by most organizations. Marketing and sales managers have the opportunity to map out brand guidelines and some basic frameworks (like content briefs, messaging frameworks, and product templates) that give customer facing sellers and reps:

* A place to start engaging beyond sales content requests and feedback. Sales reps, technical resources, and customer reps can directly contribute campaign content that reflects the needs of their audience. This can show up as blog posts, videos, and also the short form content mentioned above.
* Newsletters and other email campaigns personalized by the rep. This can be presented as 1:1 messaging by giving the reps a place to insert their own content.
* More narrative wireframes and positioning to maximize the impact on social platforms. Collaboratively develop narrative sequences that reps can personalize and post with a cadence. Putting more effort into content management and positioning can help reps stay on brand and on message.

Often, team members are motivated to do something -- to contribute and participate -- but just don't know what to do.

  "Plenty of opportunity for smart companies and smart people - we‚Äôre going to be here for a while, so focus on what we can do to help our teams stand out. If they stand out we stand out."
{{< /blockquote >}}

### Buyer side challenges

I asked Tim what's changed for the buyer's journey and what can we expect, and here's his perspective:

* Overall buyers are less responsive and maybe there's even some paralysis on what steps to take next.
* Sentiment is positive and purchasers are hard at work, but it's unclear if they're not responding due to short staffing, work overload, or other factors.

So, what can you do to engage your buyers more successfully?







Yes, there are different types of persona templates to download (like the [Hubspot persona template](https://offers.hubspot.com/persona-templates) or this [post](https://blog.hootsuite.com/buyer-persona/) from Hootsuite), and just so you know, this isn‚Äôt a re-run of the same old persona templates. 

This isn't a brand messaging guideline. Or some fluff on buyer personas (some might say ideal customer profiles).

This is the foundation for your product and marketing messaging that you‚Äôll use on a daily basis -- from short copy on your homepage to creating ads. It starts with a persona framework that I've built over years of experience and deep dives with experts to build your marketing and sales messaging foundation. It gives you the tools to expand your content once that‚Äôs in place. 

It's all about a 1:1 conversation with your audience based on that specific buyer persona.

![](/uploads/2020/01/messaging-framework-audience-hierarchy.png)

You‚Äôll focus on these key steps:

Map out the **frustrations and wants** of the ideal customer.
Capture the **fears and aspirations** of that persona.
Build **repeatable messaging** taking those key emotions and that empathy as **gain, loss aversion, and logical arguments**.

Let's do this! üí™

## Do you even need to build buyer personas?

Messaging is easy, right? No. And Yes. Well, marketing and sales messaging can come naturally to some writers and marketers, but, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve noticed that it can be really, really hard developing a consistent message that converts your ideal customer profile -- something that an entire team can ramp up on and use on a daily basis to get their work done. Staying ‚Äúon message‚Äù when it‚Äôs just you or one person writing is one thing, but when you start to scale up your teams (are you working with contract writers or agencies?) the wheels can come off the bus really fast. 

Maybe you‚Äôve already experienced this, but **here‚Äôs what can go wrong** if you don‚Äôt write down your messaging strategy and enable your teams to build off of that work:

* **Gatekeeper mode**: Your teams slow down and can‚Äôt make decisions, because all the messaging is single threaded through you (or someone).

* **Wild West mode**: Everyone is doing their own thing, and is super efficient at running in every direction with zero consistency to what‚Äôs put out in the market.

* **Babble mode**: Content is being generated that makes no sense and doesn‚Äôt align with your buyer‚Äôs perspective or their buying journey. 

* Some combination of **all** of the above

## What‚Äôs the impact of *ineffective* marketing and sales messaging?

If you don‚Äôt develop your key messages starting with the buyer personas, and if you don‚Äôt have a strategic persona framework in place that‚Äôs working, you‚Äôre going to spend more and more time:

* Coming to a marketing standstill when building out your content marketing pipeline, because you have to do deep dive reviews and rework on all the wording

* Hunting down and cleaning up ebooks, whitepapers, decks, and other assets that have incompatible messages

* Reviewing, training, and trying to bring along your team with the messaging you want to see

* Wasting everyone‚Äôs time, as they thrash around trying to come up with -- and reinventing -- the messaging every single time. 

* Losing out on deals even before they become prospects, because right now your ideal customers are doing their own research with your existing content.

## Here‚Äôs how to nail effective personas with our persona template

As I mentioned, there are a lot of incomplete templates and vague articles out there on how to go about creating your powerful marketing message (This one from [Alexa](https://blog.alexa.com/buyer-persona-template-make-top-quality-content/) is an example). The problem is that few really offer a framework and a template that is going to empower your team to create **quality content** based on conversion triggering messages tailored to your buyer. ‚ÄúCustomer problems‚Äù + ‚Äúshort message‚Äù does not equal success. You know the use-cases:

* **Short copy** - PPC ad copy (Adwords) and paid placement in newsletters
* **Medium copy** - blocks of copy on your web and landing pages
* **Long form** - entire articles, guides, presentations 

It‚Äôs very difficult to create that without a plan. Without a strategy and a **real messaging framework**. 

That‚Äôs why I suggest a different approach to creating your personas. 

**Start with a single ideal customer profile persona that you want to reach**. Teams get lost in the operations side of marketing and often skip the part where everyone acknowledges that a single person will be reading / viewing / listening to what is produced at a given moment. Groups of people don‚Äôt sit around reading a blog post together -- just one person does. Tap into what motivates the person that you want to reach that‚Äôs reading that ebook (or whatever asset), and you can definitely build messaging that converts and helps them along their journey as a buyer.

You want copy that converts -- not purely informational content. How can you design for the difference?

## How to build the ideal customer profile persona 

Start with a brief persona profile to get everyone on the team on the same page.

<div class="hero-cta center"><a href="/downloads/persona-messaging-template/">Win over your audience with our template ‚Üí</a></div>

* Brief background on the persona - The high level overview on who you‚Äôre describing. We capture specific detail below, but a general overview is a great place to start. What type of organization do they work in (B2B/B2C, SaaS/CPG/etc), and how many years of experience do they have in their role. 

* Roles and Titles -- what would they show up as on LinkedIn. Capturing all the possible titles here is valuable.

* Responsibilities -- If you review job posts for the titles you listed, what would their responsibilities include?

* Manages -- Does this person manage anyone? What roles and titles would that be if they do?

* Reports to -- Where does this person fit into the organizational hierarchy? This is really important, because we‚Äôre enabling sales and mapping the marketing messaging strategy and content to the buyer‚Äôs journey is critical.

* Decision Maker -- Does this person make the final decisions?

* Affinity Groups -- Where does this person hang out? Online? Offline? Are there trade associations they‚Äôd belong to or other professional groups?

## How to craft messaging that converts

You‚Äôre starting with the foundation of your messaging, and it‚Äôs helpful to always remember we‚Äôre creating this for an individual.  *Someone* is going to be reading your blog posts, checking out your ads, or web copy. 

I think one of the hardest things to do is create urgency -- everyone is busy and distracted with less time to try out software, services, or your product. 

The more you can speak to what they care about *right now*, the more effective your conversion will be on what you offer and your call to action. Creating and sustaining that urgency is about tapping into their current frustrations and wants, and this personas fears and aspirations. There are a lot of other ‚Äústrategic messaging frameworks‚Äù that touch on ‚Äúproblems‚Äù and introducing your ‚Äúsolution‚Äù, but miss the point of grounding the messaging with what‚Äôs on the individual‚Äôs mind at the immediate point that they are reacting to your content. State their **frustrations** or **fears** as well as they can, and **you have their attention**. Remind them of the widening gap between their frustrations and what they want, and you have a conversion. Now that you‚Äôve got a brief persona background, here‚Äôs the next step to nailing messaging that converts:

![](/uploads/2020/01/messaging-persona-template.png)
<div class="hero-cta center"><a href="/downloads/persona-messaging-template/">Map your ideal customer profile ‚Üí</a></div>


More than the problems your persona is facing at an organizational level, how can you build your foundation upon what frustrations, wants, fears, and aspirations they have on a day-to-day basis. That‚Äôs what they really care about and will motivate them. 

* **Frustrations**: Brainstorm frustrations, but try to reduce this down to the top 3 (or less) frustrations that your persona experiences that you can address. This isn‚Äôt organizational frustrations (eg our revenue isn‚Äôt increasing fast enough), but is instead personal frustrations (eg I spend too much time hunting for our official sales assets).

* **Wants**: Capture the list of what your persona wants as an alternative to each frustration. These are tactical items, so if a frustration is ‚ÄúI spend too much time hunting for our official sales assets‚Äù, then the want is something like ‚ÄúI want my entire team to have instant access to all of our official sales assets‚Äù.

* **Fears**: Brainstorm the top fears that your persona has. Fears are different than frustrations, because these are less tactical and more a view of a negative future. They might be frustrated about not finding an asset, but they‚Äôre afraid that the team won‚Äôt use the latest materials launched. 

* **Aspirations**: Just like frustrations -> wants, aspirations map to each individual fear to paint the picture of the alternative, positive future. What motivates this persona (eg promotion, recognition). If they fear that the team won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt use the latest assets from the latest launch, maybe they want to be recognized as improving the efficiency of the team by executive leadership.

We‚Äôll put this mapping to work in the next step when we actually build the messaging model. This step anchors our messaging with something an individual person(a) cares about and helps our team build a consistent and repeatable messaging strategy and process with our model below.

## How to create a messaging model with your persona
Ok, now you‚Äôre going to take your persona messaging template and expand that into your messaging model. To come up with your core marketing message examples, running a messaging workshop exercise with the team is a great activity. I‚Äôm not going to cover the logistics of doing that here, but the *Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers*, and *Changemakers* book provide a lot of really excellent examples that I‚Äôve used in a group setting. 

The template that we‚Äôll use to expand our persona frustrations, wants, fears, and aspirations into actionable messaging follows connecting with them on several levels:

* **[Loss Aversion messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion)**: the desire to reduce pain and avoid or minimize loss. Most people would prioritize not losing $5 vs finding $5.

* **Gain messaging**: Messaging to someone‚Äôs motivation for gains may resonate more with some individuals under the [Prospect Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospecttheory.asp).

* **Logical Argument messaging**: Messaging that appeals to the rational decision maker and a slower approach to making a decision. Social proof, recommendations, facts, statistics are probably already an important component of your content. 

![](/uploads/2020/01/messaging-template-detail.png)
<div class="hero-cta center"><a href="/downloads/persona-messaging-template/">Model with our persona technique ‚Üí</a></div>

This is an emotional messaging and logical messaging strategy that‚Äôs rooted in science (see *Thinking Fast and Slow* by Kahneman) and will speak to an individual‚Äôs decision making process. What I really like is that this gives you a repeatable formula to craft your message and take into consideration the audience of one that you‚Äôve identified in your persona. 

So, Start with one of the **frustrations**. And the corresponding **want**. You already have this captured in your persona messaging template above. Then, to generate your Gain message, start with a longer form version and try the starting point of:

```
With <your product or service>, you‚Äôll achieve <Want> so you can focus on <Aspiration>. 
```

You can also add in product/service capabilities and benefits tied to that Want or Aspiration, but nailing product or service value based messaging is another exercise that we cover with the best [Product Messaging Template](/blog/the-best-product-messaging-template/) and framework.

## Some buyer persona examples using our framework

Here‚Äôs copy from Zendesk‚Äôs homepage with Gain messaging:

![](/uploads/2020/01/zendesk-messaging-detail.png)

*Zendesk‚Äôs (helpdesk) makes it customer conversations seamless across all channels, so you can keep your customers happy and satisfied.*

The gain is seamless conversations (a want) and happy satisfied (retained) customers (an aspiration). The decision maker for the help desk software might be frustrated by broken multi-channel communication and they might ultimately aspire to being seen as a leader for customer retention, impacting the bottom-line. 

The original Zendesk copy is 54 words, our slimmed down version is just under 25 words. You can distill it down even more for the short version:

*Zendesk makes it easy for customers to talk with you, so you can retain them.*

That‚Äôs Gain messaging -- longer, shorter, and shortest while still retaining the essence of the message.

Next, try out Loss Aversion messaging. You‚Äôre still expanding up on just one of your frustrations and wants from the persona template. Try the longer form:

```
Avoid < frustration > with < your product / service > and accomplish < want > 
```

Zendesk doesn‚Äôt use any loss aversion messaging on their main homepage areas, so they‚Äôre missing out on telling their story multiple ways and connecting with decision makers on their terms. Intercom, though, features loss aversion messaging as a testimonial:

![](/uploads/2020/01/intercom-messaging-detail.png)

*Avoid rigid, asynchronous, impersonal connections over email only by choosing Intercom and quickly forming personal relationships with anyone.*

The want here is express as forming personal relationships with anyone (your prospects, your customers), and to do that we‚Äôre going to avoid rigid, impersonal connections with your existing email-only process. Boom.

An even shorter version could be:

*Using Intercom avoids rigid, impersonal, email-only connections enabling you to quickly form personal relationships with everyone.*

16 words. You could skinny that down, retain the message and write Adwords copy with that, right? 

Finally, appeal to the rational brain and back up your messaging with the logical argument. Can you build a logical argument with your message. Something like:

```
X% of < title and role of persona> < achieve want > or < avoid frustration > by choosing < your product / service >.
```

You‚Äôll often find logical arguments like this highlighted with case studies, but Pipedrive successfully includes this on their homepage:

![](/uploads/2020/01/pipedrive-messaging-detail.png)

They‚Äôve put the spotlight on a bunch of stats, but you can pick out the ones where they are tapping into the frustrations of their ideal customer profile and target persona. 

*VPs of Sales that chose Pipedrive gained an average 28% increase in close rates in their first year.*

*Tired of the lack of support from other CRM vendors? Pipedrive has a 60s or less customer support response time and is ranked #1 in Software Review‚Äôs 2018 and 2019 Quadrants.*

Avoiding frustrations, gaining the persona‚Äôs wants and logical stats all rolled into one to make the argument. Perfect.

## Improving your Sales Enablement with Better Messaging

OK, now you‚Äôve nailed down your more focused, conversion-oriented messaging. And you‚Äôve set up a method to scale that across your team, so everyone can write more compelling copy that speaks in a direct way to the buyer throughout their journey. What else can you do? 

Next, you can tune up your product messaging with our [free product messaging template](/blog/the-best-product-messaging-template/). It takes your persona messaging to the next level and adds more framework pieces for reatable product marketing messaging.

You can also include this information as you hand off assets to Sales. Usually, working on content and training for sales will come after a full [sales content audit](/blog/how-to-do-a-sales-content-audit/). 

As marketers, product marketers, and sales enablement specialists, there can be a gap in how we communicate, train, and all-around enable Sales as assets are typically thrown over the wall. Giving everyone the context behind who an asset is for and they key messages to drive home throughout the sales process means the hard work that went into building great content won‚Äôt go to waste.
