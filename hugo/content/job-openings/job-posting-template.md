## About Forestry.io

Forestry.io is on a mission to help people build a better web. We’re building a Git-backed content management system (CMS) and an open source site-editing toolkit ([TinaCMS](https://tinacms.org "TinaCMS")) -both focused on the JAMstack.

We’re a growing team, headquartered in PEI, Canada with roughly half our staff working remotely. We take our time hiring, and we hire for the person, not simply for the role. We value respect and empathy and we strive to reflect those values in our hiring process.

Read more about our [culture, values, hiring process and perks](https://forestry.io/careers/).

## Apply

Each job posting has a list of things that we believe will help you be successful. You don’t need to be a “rockstar” at everything on day 1. We're also looking for the interest and initiative to learn, and we're willing to help you acquire skills you may be lacking.

We value diversity on our team and strongly encourage applicants from under-represented groups in the software industry to apply.

We invite interested candidates to contact [careers@forestry.io](mailto:careers@forestry.io) and include your:

* Resume/CV
* Cover Letter
* LinkedIn or other relevant social accounts that describe your professional experience
* Links to your personal website, blog or portfolios (if available and applicable).
